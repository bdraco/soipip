# Screenlogic Over IP in Python

I wanted to see how to communicate with my Screenlogic device. This is a translation of some of the code
here: https://github.com/ceisenach/screenlogic_over_ip/ in node/js, but with Python.

I'm not sure I'm going to take this any further. If I do, it'll be to combine the functionality of 
https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController - but over IP instead of RS-485.
